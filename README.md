# Chores Bot (Work in Progress!!)
A Discord bot that can send chore reminders to an apartment group server after setting up a chores rotation and chores list.

## Implemented features:
- Can add daily, weekly, and monthly chores, as well as any chores that repeat over a set number of days.
- Can modify the chores list after creation.
- Can add a chore rotation, which can be modified after creation easily.
- Chores list and chores rotation can be displayed.

### Current feature goals:
- Can handle chores of varying frequencies, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or as-needed chores.
- Optionally, can automatically assign chores to the next person, or if one chore is handled by only one specific person, can be set to a reoccurring chore assignment.
- If a person does not mark their chore as complete, the bot reminds the person once per day until it is complete.
- Saves the "last-done" date of each chore.
